# Sutherland-Hodgman Clipping

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping algorithm. The algorithm is used to clip a polygon against a region defined by a set of lines.

## Classes

### 1. `SutherlandHodgman`
   - Performs the Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping.

## Usage

1. Create a `Shape` object to represent the region and the polygon to be clipped.
2. Instantiate `SutherlandHodgman` with the region and polygon.
3. Call the `getClippedPolygon` method to obtain the clipped polygon.
